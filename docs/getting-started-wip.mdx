Statsig helps you ship code faster on mobile, web and server side. Iterative
data-driven development is made possible by integrating one of our SDKs.

Each of our technical integration guides assumes some knowledge of the core statsig product: Feature Gates (our take on Feature Flags), Dynamic Configs, and Pulse (an A/B test analysis tool). To learn more about each of those before learning how to integrate them with your client or server, check out:

If you're ready to dive right into our SDK integration guides, read on.

For single-user, client-side applications, we have:

- [Javascript SDK](/client/jsClientSDK)
- [React SDK](/client/reactSDK)
- [React Native SDK](/client/reactNativeSDK)
- [React Native Expo SDK](/client/reactNativeExpoSDK)
- [iOS SDK](/client/iosClientSDK)
- [Android SDK](/client/androidClientSDK)
- [.NET Client SDK](/client/dotnetSDK)

For multi-user, server-side applications:

- [Node.js Server SDK](/server/nodejsServerSDK)
- [Java/Kotlin SDK](/server/javaSdk)
- [Ruby Server SDK](/server/rubySDK)
- [.NET Server SDK](/server/dotnetSDK)
- New! [Go SDK](/server/golangSDK)

We also provide an HTTP API. Our API is a great choice if an SDK isn't
available for your environment yet, as you can use it in any type of
application:

- [HTTP API](/http-api)

## Account sign up and API key {#account-sign-up-and-api-key}

Regardless of the SDK you pick, you will need to [create a free Statsig
account](https://console.statsig.com/sign_up) or be invited to join an existing
project. This will give you access to the Statsig console, where you can
generate an API key.

To get started, check out one of our guides, like [building your first feature](/guides/first-feature).

Or, if you want to poke around on your own, we recommend taking a quick tour around the console, and setting
up a Feature Gate or Dynamic Config to use when you start integrating with an SDK. Our
SDKs function as a bridge to your Statsig console -- once you have integrated an
SDK into your application, you can update Feature Gate conditions or Dynamic
Config values directly in the console, with your application responding
immediately to the new values!

## FAQ {#faq}

#### I don't see my language listed, can I still use Statsig? {#i-dont-see-my-language-listed-can-i-still-use-statsig}

We just released our beta, which includes a few SDKs, as well as an HTTPS API.
If none of these fit your needs, let us know! Email tore [at] statsig [dot]
com. We're working hard to bring the power of Statsig to your client or server
with more SDKs coming every week.

#### I want to run an A/B test, can I use Statsig for that? {#i-want-to-run-an-ab-test-can-i-use-statsig-for-that}

You can run A/B tests by opening up a partial rollout on any Feature Gates.
You then analyze the results of the experiment in the "Pulse" tab of the console.
We're actively working on support for multivariate experiments (A/B/...N tests), mutual exclusivity for experiments, and much more.
