### Reading experiment results

To read the results of your experiment, you can zoom straight into your key metrics as well as your starred metrics that are relevant for your experiment. 
You can also deep dive into how all your metrics shifted with the experiment.   

#### Key Results
The **Key Results** panel shows how your primary metrics compare against the control for each variant.

In the example below, the **Square** variant is performing better than the **Rounded Square (control)** and **Circle** variant on all Key Metrics.

#### Metrics Lifts
The **Metrics Lifts** panel shows how your *favorited* metrics compare against the control. You can also see how *all* your other metrics compare against the control in the **All Other Metrics** section as shown below.

### Significance Level Settings

These settings can be adjusted at any time to view Pulse results with different significance levels.  

* **Apply Bonferroni Correction**: Select this option to apply the correction in experiments with more than one test group. This reduces the probability of Type I errors (false positives) by adjusting the significance level alpha, which will be divided by the number of test variants in the experiment.
* **Confidence Interval**: Changes the confidence interval displayed with the metric deltas.  Choose lower confidence intervals (e.g.: 80%) when there's higher tolerance for false positives and fast iteration with directional results is preferred over longer/larger experiments with increased certainty.
