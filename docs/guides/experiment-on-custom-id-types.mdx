title: Experiment on custom ID types

Sometimes you may want to randomize experiment bucketing based on a ID other than the user ID. For example, say your company builds tasks management tools for other companies to use - you
need to run an experiment to test different experiences for a tool, but you want to make sure everyone in the same company gets the same experience, so that you can understand how
the different experiences differ in improving overall productivity for a company. In this case, you want the unit ID on your experiment to be `companyID` instead of `userID`, so that
every user with the same `companyID` is in the same group for the experiment.

It takes just 3 easy steps to set up an experiment like this. Below we will use `companyID` as an example, but you can replace it with any name that suits your use case.

### Step 1 - Add `companyID` as a new ID Type in your project settings

Log into the Statsig console at https://console.statsig.com/ and navigate to Project Settings in top-right panel, and then find "ID Type Settings" section under the "Basic Settings" tab.

You will see that "User ID" and "Stable ID" are already there by default.

Now click on the "Edit" button to add your new ID type and description:

Once the new ID type is added, you can use it for all new experiments going forward - no need to repeat this step again!

### Step 2 - Select `companyID` as the ID Type for your new experiment

When you create the experiment, simply select `companyID` under the "ID Type" dropdown in the "Advanced" section.

Now go ahead and finish the rest of the set up as you would for any [user-level experiment](./first-experiment).

### Step 3 - Provide `companyID` on the user object when using Statsig SDK

Now all you need to do is making sure `companyID` is provided when initializing any client SDK, or when getting the experiment configs and logging events if using a server SDK. The Statsig user object has a top level field `customIDs`
that is a dictionary of key-value pairs representing the ID type and value for the user:

```jsx
var user = {
    userID: "some_user_id",
    customIDs: {
        companyID: "some_company_id",
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

That's it! Now go ahead and start your experiment!
