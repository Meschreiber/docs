User Segments allow you to predefine targeting groups for re-use in Feature Gates and Dynamic Configs.  Think of it as a reusable macro for a set of users.
Need an easy way to roll things out to just your team/org/company?  Create a segment, and use a "User is in Segment" or "User is not in Segment" condition to setup
your feature gates.

## Step 1: Creating a Segment

Let's create an example segment to identify our internal users.

Start by navigating to the "Segments" tab in the console:

Then click "Create New."  Lets call it "Internal Stakeholders:"

Now, lets add some rules to identify those users.

First, lets target people on our internal environments (see our [environments guide](https://docs.statsig.com/guides/usingEnvironments) for more info):

Next, lets add another condition to that same rule.  Click "Add more conditions", and then use an "email" "contains any of" condition to target internal employees:

Don't forget to "Save Changes" after adding those!  Your Segment should look like this:

## Step 2: Using a segment

Now, lets make a gate for our new feature, "Landing Page Redesign".  Navigate to "Feature Gates" and click "Create New"

![Screen Shot 2021-07-30 at 12 58 22 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/127705559-310834b8-caa8-4f74-b105-e8736cd3ae4a.png)

Since this feature isn't ready for the public, lets gate it to our internal stakeholders using the Segment we just created.

Click "Add New Rule"

Again, remember to "Save Changes"

## Step 3: Test it!
Fill in the test gate console with any random user input.  You won't be able to get this gate to pass until you pass in a user with an email ending
in `statsig.com` or `statsig.io` AND a development or staging environment like this:

```
{
  email: 'tore@statsig.com',
  statsigEnvironment: {
    tier: "development"
  }
}
```

![Screen Shot 2021-07-30 at 1 01 21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74584483/127705951-6813bb6e-0ae7-44a2-8db3-421e11e54c5c.png)

There you have it!  You can reuse this Segment in as many Feature Gates or Dynamic Configs as you want to gate your internal features while they are under development.
