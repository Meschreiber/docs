It is important to **make sure API calls to `Statsig` are made from the main thread** to ensure everything functions correctly. Operations that take longer like network requests are made asynchronously so they will not block the main thread.

```csharp
using StatsigUnity;

await Statsig.Initialize(
    "client-sdk-key",
    new StatsigUser { UserID = "some_user_id", Email = "user@email.com" },
    new StatsigOptions // optional parameters to customize your Statsig client, see "Statsig Options" section below to see details on available options
    {
        EnvironmentTier = EnvironmentTier.Development,
        InitializeTimeoutMs = 5000,
    }
);
```
