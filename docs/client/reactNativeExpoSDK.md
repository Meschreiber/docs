title: React Native Expo SDK
---

Statsig client side SDK for applications in React Native using Expo. If you are not using Expo, check out our plain [React Native SDK](./reactNativeSDK). This SDK is based on our [JavaScript client SDK](https://github.com/statsig-io/js-client).

## Installation

You can install the SDK via npm or yarn.

**via npm:**

```shell
$ npm i --save statsig-react-native-expo
```

**via yarn:**

```shell
$ yarn add statsig-react-native-expo
```

## Usage
Because our React Native Expo SDK is based on our [JavaScript client SDK](./jsClientSDK), you can use them exactly the same way. Check out the [usage guide](./jsClientSDK#initialize) to learn about how to initialize Statsig and use Feature Gates or Dynamic Configs.
