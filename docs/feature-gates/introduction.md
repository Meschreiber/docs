# What is a feature gate?
A feature gate is a mechanism for teams to control rolling out new features without changing application code. Feature gates are also commonly called feature flags or feature toggles. 

## When to use feature gates
Feature gates allow teams to gradually ramp up a software release across their user base to limit the impact of any unanticipated system behavior, or to enable a restricted behavior only for a specific set of users. Feature gates can also be used simply as on/off switches to turn a certain system behavior on or off in production.  

To get started, see the Statsig guides to:
 - [Build your first feature gate](/guides/first-feature)
 - [Log events to create custom metrics](/guides/logging-events)
 - [Use environments](/guides/using-environments)

To learn about all that you can do with feature gates, see the Statsig tutorial to [working with feature gates](/feature-gates/working-with).
