## **title: Hightouch**

## **Overview**

Enabling the **[Hightouch](https://hightouch.com/)** integration allows you to send events and keep segments up-to-date in Statsig via Hightouch. You can ingest data into Statsig from [any source](https://hightouch.com/integrations) that Hightouch supports.

You can find all events that Statsig receives from Hightouch in the **[Metrics](https://chat.openai.com/metrics)** tab in the Statsig console, if you’re on a [Pro plan](https://www.statsig.com/pricing). Statsig automatically includes these events in **[Pulse](https://chat.openai.com/pulse)** and **[Experiment](https://chat.openai.com/experiments-plus/monitor)** results for your feature gates and experiments respectively. You can view your updated segment lists on the **[Segments](https://console.statsig.com/segments)** page.

## **Event configuration**

1. From the **[API Keys](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys)** tab in the Statsig console, copy the Statsig **Client-SDK API key.**
2. Go to the Hightouch **[Destinations** overview page](https://app.hightouch.com/destinations) and click the **Add destination**
button. Select **Statsig** and click **Continue**. You can then authenticate Hightouch to **Statsig** by entering the appropriate key.
3. Once you've set up your Statsig destination and have a [model](https://hightouch.com/docs/getting-started/concepts#models) to pull data from, you can set up your sync configuration to begin syncing data. Go to the **[Syncs** overview page](https://app.hightouch.com/syncs) and click the **Add sync** button to begin. Then, select the relevant model and the Statsig destination you previously set-up.
4. Select **Events** as the sync type.
5. Enter either a static value or select a column that contains **event names**.
6. Optionally, select a column that contains the event timestamp. If empty, Statsig uses the time the event arrives at the server.
7. Choose source columns to sync as event metadata and user attributes, such as the **User ID**.
8. Finally, select whether you want the first sync to backfill event data or not. For more information about configuration options see [Hightouch’s Statsig docs](https://hightouch.com/docs/destinations/statsig#events).
9. Run the sync and check that events appear in your Statsig **[Metrics](https://chat.openai.com/metrics)** tab.

## Segment configuration

The Hightouch integration lets you keep your segments up-to-date by adding or removing members based on changes in your source dataset. 

1. From the **[API Keys](https://console.statsig.com/api_keys)** tab in the Statsig console, copy the Statsig **Console API key.**
2. Go to the Hightouch **[Destinations** overview page](https://app.hightouch.com/destinations) and click the **Add destination**
button. Select **Statsig** and click **Continue**. You can then authenticate Hightouch to **Statsig** by entering the appropriate key.
3. Once you've set up your Statsig destination and have a [model](https://hightouch.com/docs/getting-started/concepts#models) to pull data from, you can set up your sync configuration to begin syncing data. Go to the **[Syncs** overview page](https://app.hightouch.com/syncs) and click the **Add sync** button to begin. Then, select the relevant model and the Statsig destination you previously set-up.
4. Select **Segment** as the sync type.
5. Select whether you would like to create a new audience or use an existing audience to sync data to. If creating a new audience, you can give it a name. If you leave this input blank, Hightouh uses the name of your model for the audience.
6. Select the audience's ID type: either **userID** or **stableID**.
7. Select the source column and Statsig field to match records on. For more information see Hightouch's docs on [record matching](https://hightouch.com/docs/syncs/record-matching).
5. [Schedule your sync](https://hightouch.com/docs/syncs/schedule-sync-ui) to run as frequently as you need. You can view your updated segment lists on the **[Segments](https://console.statsig.com/segments)** page.
