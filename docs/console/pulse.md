title: Pulse
---

Pulse is inspired by Deltoid, Facebook's internal A/B testing tool. You can learn more about the general ideas here: [Itamar Rosenn (Facebook) - A/B Tests and Deltoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw40wdwkkLA)

Lots of technology companies have similar tools. For example, [Spotify's ABBA](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/10/29/spotifys-new-experimentation-platform-part-1/), and [Uber's Experimentation Platform (XP)](https://eng.uber.com/xp/) accomplish the same goal.

Statsig's Pulse, combined with Feature Gates and Dynamic Config, will allow you to bring powerful experimentation to your application as well!

Pulse is currently under development. Check back soon for more!
