A holdout is a group of users that are held out of one or more experiments to measure the combined impact of that set of experiments. You can think of it as a "global control group" - while each experiment you run will compare the control and test groups for that feature, a holdout will compare the "global control" (users who never got ANY experiment) with users who may have been in one or more experiments.
