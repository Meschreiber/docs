You would use Autotune when you just want to optimize a single metric (eg. click-through rate). Give it 2 (or more) variations and specify which metric you care about. It will initially split traffic equally (50/50), but as it collects more data, it will divert traffic to the “winner” as it becomes increasingly confident (using a Bayesian engine). You will not get the full suite a metrics like our A/B/n testing tool, but you can definitely set this up and forget it.
