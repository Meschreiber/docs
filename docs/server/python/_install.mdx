Install the sdk using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/statsig/):

```
pip install statsig
```

:::info
The python SDK is currently a lightweight wrapper around a shared library built from our [Go sdk](/server/golangSDK).  If you do not have Go installed, pip will fail to install Statsig.  We are working on building out a fully native python SDK, so bear with us until that is complete.
