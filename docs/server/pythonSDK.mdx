title: Python Server SDK for Statsig
---

The first party python SDK is under development.

For now, if you need a python SDK, you have a few choices:

1. Write a python library that wraps the Statsig [http api](https://docs.statsig.com/http-api) to check Feature Gates/Dynamic Configs and log events
2. Create a c-style shared library from our [go sdk](https://docs.statsig.com/server/golangSDK), and then wrap that in new python library.
