Now that you have created your [Statsig account](/#account-sign-up-and-api-key), and perhaps even your [first feature](/first-feature), make our app
a bit more configurable with Dynamic Config.

:::infoNOTE: This guide focuses on a client-side example, as it is easier to illustrate how Dynamic Configs work and can be used.  You can and still should use
Dynamic Config on the server side as well, for any constants you may have, or confurations for ranking systems, algorithms, etc that may need to be updated on the fly.

In this guide we will be building a front page banner - something that may show up on an ecommerce site to advertise an upcoming sale, for instance.
Here, I will apply it to a stripped down version of the Statsig homepage.

If you want to follow along with a simple js repl, check out [this codepen](https://codepen.io/tore-statsig/pen/mdWEajo) -
all the code from this example (and the corresponding screenshots) come from here.

### Step 1 - Create a new Dynamic Config

Start by creating a new Dynamic Config. Pick a name related to the set of variables this config will hold. For this example, we are building a homepage banner.
Lets call it "Banner Config"
